# ITU-ML5G-PS-010: Forecasting Model for Service Allocation Network Using Traffic Recognition

## Description
Focusing on the intelligent application demand of networking management and computing resource management, the artificial intelligence technologies such as machine learning and big data include the possibilities of the softwarized approach in IMT-2020 (SDN/NFV) are applied to digital upgrade of the internet infrastructure. The one of the main issues in this area - is the services traffic allocation, taking into account the users dynamics. Here we propose the problem statement with the services traffic forecasting based on the changing user needs for services.
The suggestion of problem statement:

- Proposal with ML model for recognizing the user demands based on the traffic services allocation;
- Proposal with ML model for traffic forecasting, taking into account traffic types and user demands (in order to future service migration).

## Evaluation criteria

Solutions with lower MAPE and RMSE score for Task 2 and high probability in % of recognition in Task 1 will be the winners.
The output format is the report (expected) which include the following:
Problem analysis include the Gap analysis of current approaches for solve defined research problem (~2 pages);

1. Architectural scheme, models, algorithm in UML notation
(~1 page);
2. Description of solution/suggestion (~1 page);
3. Results of modelling in the graphs and their explanation
(~ 1-2 pages);
4. Source software with ML and Big data (if necessary) algorithms;
Trained ML-models;
5. Results in the CSV file, which contains results of training: necessary parameters (MAPE & RSME, Probability).
*the “.docx” format is required for report.
