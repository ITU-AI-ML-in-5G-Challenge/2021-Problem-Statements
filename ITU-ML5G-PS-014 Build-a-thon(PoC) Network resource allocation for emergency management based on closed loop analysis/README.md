# ITU-ML5G-PS-014: Build-a-thon(PoC) Network resource allocation for emergency management based on closed loop analysis

## Description
Future mobile networks including 6G are expected to use AI/ML based closed loops for performing various network operations. Our goal is to orchestrate a set of hierarchical autonomous AI/ML based closed loops in the mobile network. These closed loops should be able to perform operations like disaster detection, ML Pipeline management etc. Participants are expected to use relevant simulators as well as the 5G Berlin testbed for this purpose.

The challenge is divided into 5 activities. You would be asssigned to one of the activites.
Each activity is divided into goals, you need to fulfill these goals in order to complete the activity.

You can find details about activities and their goals in the challenge introduction tutorial here:

## Evaluation criteria

1. How many goals in a activity are achieved.
2. PoC (proof of concept) demonstrates the feasibility (or lack of it) of specific architecture approaches.
3. Quality of technical reports, papers and presentation of github code and demo.
4. Participation and engagement with mentors, regular and timely progress.
    Bonus points: Providing feedback reagarding requirements/gaps in key concepts of autonomous networks to FG-AN.
